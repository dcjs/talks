Presenting at DCJS
===================

First of all, thank you so much for volunteering to present to the DCJS users group! This document is a work in progress that tries to give speakers a little bit of data before they present. Have questions? Make a comment!


Agenda
------

The meetup starts at 7pm. Folks generally start filtering in between 6:30 and 7:15, so don't expect to start talking right at 7pm. We generally start around 7:15 with announcements and then go right into the presentation.

Your presentation (if there’s only one of you) should be 45 minutes or less, but it’s absolutely no problem to go longer or shorter. We recognize that you’re volunteering your time and not being paid to do it.


A few things about the group
----------------------------

We have over 1,000 members, but actual meetup sizes tend to be groups between 50 and 70.

While our name is DCJS, we used to be DCjQuery, so our membership tends towards front end developers. A more apt name would probably be the “DC Front-End Javascript users group,” but that’s such a mouthful!

Group members’ experience is quite a range. It can run from the “I heard about this jQuery thing” crowd to the “I use nvm to switch between multiple versions of node” guys. You don’t have to appeal to every group of users - just make sure that you have interesting information in your talk that you would find valuable and folks will pick up what they can.


Logistics
---------

At the venue, you may need to get let in and up by the security guard. If you ever have trouble, just call your trusty organizer who will send you their contact details when you're confirmed to present.

Generally you shouldn't have to worry about adapters or the projector unless you have either a very old or very new laptop.


Other things
-----------

Are you hiring? Is your company? Let us know before hand. We’ll tell people about it in announcements.

If you use a fancy JS library to show your slides, expect people to ask you what library it was and where they can find it posted. If you can provide us with the link ahead of time, we’ll post right after the presentation.

Expect questions!
