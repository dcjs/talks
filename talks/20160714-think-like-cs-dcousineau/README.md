DCJS Meetup, July 14th, 2016
============================

Abstract
--------

Often times, we hit a wall and get stuck on a problem, only to realize much later - and after lengthy and unnecessary pain- that the solution was simple if we had just reframed the problem as something else. Thinking like a Computer Scientist involves being able to take a step back, abstracting what we know about a problem space, and realizing relations to other, solved, problems that were not, and come away with that "aha!" moment that we all know and love immediately apparent. Together, we'll tackle a problem and along the way learn how to think as developers.
