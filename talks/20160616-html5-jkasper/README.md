DCJS Meetup, June 16th, 2016
============================

Abstract
--------

JavaScript has come a long way since the dark days of IE's domination of the browser market. In this talk, Jordan Kasper will introduce you to some of the exciting new features in HTML5 that we can implement _right now_ in our applications! We'll look at capturing the user's camera data, access their location, reading the file system, native drag and drop, and even vibrating their phone! Join us for an evening of fun demos and new experiences. You'll walk away from this session with some ideas about how to make your web applications even more amazing with these new APIs.
