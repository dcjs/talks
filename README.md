# DCJS Talks

Want to speak at [DCJS](http://www.meetup.com/DC-JavaScript/)? We'd love to have you! Finding great speakers is one of the most difficult parts about running a meetup and we _love_ when folks volunteer.

## Short Version

If you have a topic you'd like to speak on, open a [new issue](https://github.com/dcjs/talks/issues/new) and fill out the fields (make the title of the issue your suggested topic). Talks can be anywhere from 5 to 45 minutes - we'll make sure to fill out a meetup if you just want to give a short talk! Your issue will be reviewed by the organizers and we'll get back to you with any questions!

Please read the [Speaker Primer](speaker-primer.md) before your talk!

## Long Version

We really appreciate your effort! We're looking for any talks relating to JavaScript, and this doesn't mean only fancy, cool new stuff, either. Want to talk about closures? Great! Do you have an interesting case study of how you solved a problem with JS? Neat! Want to talk about how framework [X] does [Y]? Awesome! **We do want our talks to be technical**, so please try to keep that in mind - no marketing/sales pitches, no company overviews, no product ideas.

**You do _not_ need to be a senior developer with 60 years experience to present!** We have a good mix of all levels of developers at this meetup and if you've learned something cool, chances are many of our attendees would like to hear about it! If you need help developing your idea let us know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dcjavascript) or in your [talk idea issue](https://github.com/dcjs/talks/issues/new). We're happy to help flesh out your topic.

Once you have a topic in mind, go ahead and fill out a talk request using [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/dcjs/talks/issues/new). There is a template built in, please fill out as much as you know. We'll review the topic and ask any questions in the comments on that issue. Once the idea is ready to go we'll get it on the schedule and work with you to prepare!

As your talk approaches you'll want to review the [Speaker Primer](speaker-primer.md) we've prepared. Of course, we'll continue to help any way we can up until, and even after, your talk.
