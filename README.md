# talks

Want to speak at DCJS? We'd love to have you! Finding great speakers is one of the most difficult parts about running a meetup and we _love_ when folks volunteer.

Short version: if you have topic you'd like to speak on, open an issue and describe the subject. Talks can be anywhere from 5 to 45 minutes, so please use the [Issue Template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).
