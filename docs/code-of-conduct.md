## Code of Conduct

In order to ensure an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone; all attendees, speakers, sponsors, organizers, and volunteers at any DCJS event are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Participation in the DCJS community is considered agreement with the code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event and in DCJS spaces online, and we hope that the rest of the community will help us in doing so.

### Abstract

DC Javascript (DCJS) is dedicated to providing a welcoming, respectful community for everyone who participates in or supports our meetup. Because we value the safety and security of our members and strive to have an inclusive community, we do not tolerate harassment of members, event participants, or volunteers in any form. If harassment involves any participant in  the DCJS community, the individual or individuals participating in the harassing behavior will be asked to cease the behavior, and may be asked to leave the event by a DCJS organizer. They are expected to comply immediately.

### Specifics

DCJS is dedicated to providing a respectful and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), technology choices, or any other manner in which they identify not enumerated here. We do not tolerate harassment of meetup participants in any form. 

Forms of harassment include sexual language and imagery; sexist, racist, and exclusionary jokes; and symbols and acts that insult or belittle other event attendees. These are unacceptable at any and all DCJS events and in DCJS spaces online. Other forms of harassment and discriminatory behavior include, but are not limited to: offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic status, or any other manner in which an individual identifies not enumerated here; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; photography or recording without consent of identifiable individuals; sustained disruption of event programming; inappropriate or unsolicited physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. 

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to immediately comply and may be removed from the event without warning by any DCJS organizer. 

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, you agree to notify a DCJS organizer in a timely manner so the issue can be addressed. We will be happy to help members address their concerns, provide escorts, contact local law enforcement if necessary, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. 

### Dictatorship Clause

Attempts at dictatorship or world domination in any form that take place at any DCJS event or DCJS online spaces - including attempts by DCJS organizers - are strictly banned. Participants asked to stop any dictatorial behavior are expected to immediately comply and may be removed from the event without warning by any DCJS organizer. 

### Thanks for supporting a safe and inclusive DCJS!
